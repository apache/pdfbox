Release Notes -- Apache PDFBox -- Version 2.0.0-RC1

Introduction

The Apache PDFBox library is an open source Java tool for working with PDF documents.

This is a first release candidate for the upcoming major release 2.0.0 of PDFBox.

About The Apache Software Foundation
------------------------------------

Established in 1999, The Apache Software Foundation provides organizational,
legal, and financial support for more than 100 freely-available,
collaboratively-developed Open Source projects. The pragmatic Apache License
enables individual and commercial users to easily deploy Apache software;
the Foundation's intellectual property framework limits the legal exposure
of its 2,500+ contributors.
