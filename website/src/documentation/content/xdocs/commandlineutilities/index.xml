      <p>
	      PDFBox comes with a series of command line utilities.  They are available as windows binaries
	      and as standard Java applications.  
      </p>
      <p>
	      In order to run them as java applications you need to add the following jars to your classpath
	  </p>
      <ul>

      	<li>%PDFBOX_HOME%\lib\PDFBox-0.X.X.jar</li>
      </ul>
