Apache PDFBox
===================================================

The [Apache PDFBox](https://pdfbox.apache.org/) library is an open source Java tool for working with PDF 
documents. This project allows creation of new PDF documents, manipulation 
of existing documents and the ability to extract content from documents.
PDFBox also includes several command line utilities. PDFBox is published
under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

PDFBox is a project of the [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/).

Known Limitations and Problems
------------------------------

See the [Issue Tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PDFBOX) for
the full list of known issues and requested features. Some of the more
common issues are:

1. You get text like "G38G43G36G51G5" instead of what you expect when you are
   extracting text. This is because the characters are a meaningless internal
   encoding that point to glyphs that are embedded in the PDF document. The
   only way to access the text is to use OCR. This may be a future
   enhancement.

2. You get an error message like `java.io.IOException: Can't handle font width`
   this MIGHT be due to the fact that you don't have the
   **org/apache/pdfbox/resources** directory in your classpath. The easiest
   solution is to include the **apache-pdfbox-x.x.x.jar** in your classpath.

3. You get text that has the correct characters, but in the wrong
   order.  This mght be because you have not enabled sorting.  The text
   in PDF files is stored in chunks and the chunks do not need to be stored 
   in the order that they are displayed on a page.  By default, PDFBox does 
   not sort the text.
