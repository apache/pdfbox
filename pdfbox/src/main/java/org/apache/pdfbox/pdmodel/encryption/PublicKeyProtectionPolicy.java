 * PublicKeyRecipient recip = new PublicKeyRecipient();
 * AccessPermission ap = new AccessPermission();
 * ap.setCanModify(false);
 * recip.setPermission(ap);
 *
 * // load the recipient's certificate
 * InputStream inStream = new FileInputStream(certificate_path);
 * CertificateFactory cf = CertificateFactory.getInstance("X.509");
 * X509Certificate certificate = (X509Certificate)cf.generateCertificate(inStream);
 * inStream.close();
 *
 * recip.setX509(certificate); // set the recipient's certificate
 * policy.addRecipient(recip);
 * policy.setEncryptionKeyLength(128); // the document will be encrypted with 128 bits secret key
 * doc.protect(policy);
 * doc.save(out);
