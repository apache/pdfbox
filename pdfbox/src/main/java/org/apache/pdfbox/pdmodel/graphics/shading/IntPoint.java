/**
 * Point class with faster hashCode() to speed up the rendering of Gouraud shadings. Should only be
 * used for maps or sets when all elements are of this type, because the hashCode() method violates
 * its general contract "If two objects are equal according to the equals(Object) method, then
 * calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce the same" when IntPoint is
 * mixed with Point, because IntPoint(x,y) would have a different hashCode than Point(x,y).
