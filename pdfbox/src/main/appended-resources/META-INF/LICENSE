   redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves.
   The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
   redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
   names are not used by derivative works.  The fonts and derivatives,
   however, cannot be released under any other type of license.  The

   any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
