    control laws, including the U.S. Export
    Administration Act and its associated
    regulations, and may be subject to export or

    jurisdiction, then such provisions are
    herewith waived or amended to the extent
    necessary for the License to be otherwise
    enforceable in such jurisdiction.  However,
    if in Sun's opinion deletion or amendment of
    any provisions of the License by operation of
    this paragraph unreasonably compromises the
    rights or increase the liabilities of Sun or
    its licensors, Sun reserves the right to
    terminate the License.
